## E2 — Note round-trip fidelity, grid, observer gotcha (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● §5's "Exact" checkpoint-fidelity claim holds for the note
surface, with one asterisk (gain).** Probes: `e02` (full sweep, partially
contaminated by external project-state changes mid-run) + `e02b`
(clean re-characterization on known clips).

### Write/read mechanics

- **`setStep` is NOT visible in the same request** — immediate `getStep`
  after `setStep` in one handler returns `Empty`. It IS visible on the
  next request (~25ms incl. round-trip). ⇒ readback verification (§8c)
  must be a separate tick after the write batch, never inline.
- **`getStep` scan cost is trivial:** 512×128 grid = 65k steps scans in
  2–10ms; 64×128 in ~0.4–1ms. Full-clip snapshots are effectively free.
- **Observer gotcha, precisely characterized:** `getStep`/`NoteStep` needs
  NO subscription at all (works on a cursor with zero `markInterested`).
  Every `Value.get()` (exists, name, position…) throws
  `"Either call markInterested() or add at least one observer in init"`
  without a mark. ⇒ mark everything scalar; note data is implicit.
- **Muted notes remain visible** to the NoteOn scan with `isMuted=true` —
  snapshots see them.

### Expression property fidelity (21-property sweep; re-verified on clean fixture)

All setters accepted; round-trip exact (±2e-3) for: velocity,
releaseVelocity, velocitySpread, duration, pan, timbre (float noise only),
transpose (fractional ok), chance+enable, occurrence (enum)+enable,
recurrence (length+mask)+enable, repeat count/curve/velocityCurve/
velocityEnd+enable, isMuted. Two API quirks, both now precisely modeled:

- **`gain` reads back 2× the written value** (reproducible on clean
  state: set 0.7 → immediate read 0.7 [cached] → settled read 1.4; javadoc
  claims 0..1 both ways). Checkpoint restore mapping: write `read/2`.
  Verify the inverse mapping holds in Phase 1; likely a Bitwig doc/API bug.
- **`setGain` and `setTimbre` each RESET `pressure` to 0** (isolated in
  e02e; every other property is innocent; pressure re-set afterwards
  sticks). ⇒ property-write ordering rule: **pressure last** (or at least
  after gain/timbre) in any note-property batch — and §8c readback
  verification catches violations structurally.

### Grid

- **`setStepSize` works at runtime** (note at beat 1.0 re-indexed 4→8
  after 0.25→0.125 switch; needs a settle wait — not instant).
- **Triplet grids work** (stepSize 1/6 round-trips).
- **Off-grid notes are visible on coarser grids, snapped DOWN** (a note
  at beat 0.09375 scans as x=0 on the 0.25 grid) — coarse scans don't
  lose notes but misreport positions; snapshots should scan at the
  finest grid.
- ⇒ grid is a *view*; resolution is per-cursor and changeable. The
  contract can stay beats-native and quantize per operation to a chosen
  grid; no global init-time grid needed (daw-mcp's design was
  unnecessarily rigid).

### Addressing corollaries (feed the batch executor design)

- **Pointing at an EMPTY slot silently lands the cursor on the WRONG
  clip** — observed staying on the previous clip in one trial and
  attaching to a different clip on the target track (slot 0) in another;
  in both cases status looks healthy. ⇒ create-clip must precede
  pointing; the executor MUST verify the cursor's target (track position
  + scene index) before every write — a mis-point is undetectable
  afterwards from the cursor's own state.
- **No stale reads after clip deletion:** `ClipLauncherSlot.deleteObject()`
  (works, ~24ms) leaves the cursor with `exists=false`, scan returns 0
  notes. Cursor reads are trustworthy when `exists=true` + target
  verified.
- **The e02 cross-session anomalies are fully resolved by E2c** (track
  identity bug — see that section): the "fixture" was actually the FX and
  Master rows. Bonus discovery: `createNewLauncherClip` + full note
  editing WORKS on FX/Master launcher slots. After cleanup (E2d) the
  whole E1a + E2 suite re-ran green on a genuine instrument-track
  fixture.
- **Arranger cursor clip:** created fine; `exists=false` with no
  arrangement clip selected. Deeper arrangement probing stays out of
  scope (§9 lean).

### Decision impact

- Checkpoint design (§8b): full-fidelity note snapshots are cheap and
  exact (gain excepted) — snapshot = verbose scan of the write-set clips.
- Readback loop: write → next-tick verify → report; ~25ms per turn.
- Units (§7): contract in beats; extension quantizes via per-op stepSize.
- E3 signals banked: both Track and ClipLauncherSlot `deleteObject()`
  confirmed working.

## E2c — Track identity: the fixture-contamination root cause (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● the cross-session anomalies were OUR bug — track addressing
by (bank index | name) is unsound. Three API facts, all confirmed by
controlled trials (`e02c`):**

1. **The flat TrackBank includes the FX section and the MASTER track**
   after the regular tracks. `trackType()` distinguishes them
   (Instrument/Audio/Effect/Master/Hybrid/Group). daw-mcp-derived code
   treated bank size as "number of regular tracks" — wrong.
2. **`Application.createInstrumentTrack(position)` does not honor bank
   positions:** requesting the end (9) landed at index 7 (end of the
   *regular* section, before FX/Master); requesting 0 landed at index 1.
   The position argument cannot be trusted; the only safe procedure is
   create → diff the bank → locate the new row empirically.
3. **Default track names auto-renumber** ("Inst 2", "Audio 3" are
   positional auto-names, not stable identities). Name-based identity is
   meaningless for unnamed tracks, and `setName(bankIndex)` renames
   whatever currently sits at that index.

**Combined effect on E1/E2 sessions:** every `ensureFixtureTracks` run
created a track that landed *not* at the assumed index, then renamed the
wrong row — accumulating orphaned "Inst N" tracks and, at least once,
sticking the fixture name onto the tail of the bank (the row typed
Master now carries the name "gn-A"). Cross-session name lookups then
found the wrong tracks, explaining the E2 phase D/E anomalies and the
user's "gn-A wasn't there" observation. In-session fingerprint-verified
results (all of E1's core verdicts, E2's mechanics) are self-consistent
and stand.

**Resolution (same day):** user visually confirmed (screenshots): the
Master row was named "gn-A", fixture clips lived on the FX/Master rows,
and the default template was Inst+Audio+FX+Master — every extra
Instrument row was a ghostnote orphan. Cleanup probe (`e02d`) removed
our clips from FX/Master, restored the Master name, and deleted the five
verified-empty orphans; fixture code (`lib.ensureFixtureTracks`) now
matches by name+type, locates created tracks as last-Instrument-row, and
poll-verifies renames. E1a and E2 both re-ran green on the clean fixture.

**Decision impact (batch executor / contract):**
- Track creation in the contract must return the *located* new track
  (create → diff → verify), never assume the requested position.
- All track addressing must be type-aware; Effect/Master rows are never
  fixture/rename/delete targets by index.
- Rename operations must poll-verify the rename landed where intended.
- This is the strongest argument yet for §8e verification semantics:
  every structural op needs its own readback, not just note writes.

## E1 — Addressing: pointing, pinning, cursor pool (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● address-don't-select is achievable.** The pool-of-cursors
architecture works: writes land on programmatically chosen clips and are
immune to concurrent user interaction. E1a: 26/28 (the 2 "failures" were
mechanism discovery, see below). E1b (interactive): all real checks passed;
the one FAIL was a mis-designed control test (see 4).

### The working architecture

Per pool slot: a dedicated `CursorTrack` created with
`shouldFollowSelection=false` + its `PinnableCursorClip`
(`cursorTrack.createLauncherCursorClip(w, h)`). Pointing mechanism —
the only one of three candidates that works (**"trackThenSlot"**):

```java
cursorTrack.selectChannel(trackBank.getItemAt(t));  // point the track
track.selectSlot(s);                                 // point the slot
// then pin: cursorClip.isPinned().set(true)
```

Settle is **~25ms, verifiable by polling** `clip.getTrack().position()` +
`clip.clipLauncherSlot().sceneIndex()` — vs. daw-mcp's blind 400ms sleep.

Rejected mechanisms: `slot.select()` alone (pool clips do not follow
global clip selection — their cursor tracks don't follow, and the clip
cursor is scoped to its track) and `CursorClip.selectClip(followerClip)`
(does not repoint cross-track; timed out).

### Evidence highlights

1. **Pool independence ●** — 3 cursors pinned to 3 different clips
   concurrently, each reads back its own fingerprint.
2. **User-interference immunity ●** — 20/20 write+readback cycles correct
   while the user clicked continuously around the session view
   (27 selection changes observed during the test window).
3. **Structural shift: pins follow the object ●** — creating a track at
   position 0 shifted the pinned cursor's reported position +1 with
   content intact; deleting restored it. Bank *indices* drift (fixture
   moved between sessions in testing) ⇒ the brain must resolve addresses
   to objects (via pointed cursors), never store raw bank indices.
4. **Selection-following is opt-in by construction ●** — pool cursors
   never follow user selection even unpinned (`followSelection=false` at
   creation). The E1b "control test" FAIL was this architecture working:
   the test wrongly expected an unpinned pool cursor to follow a click
   (compounded by clicking an already-selected clip = no change event).
   Pinning is belt-and-suspenders on top of a non-following cursor.
5. **`Track.deleteObject()` works ●** (~144ms settle) — early E3 positive:
   structural revert has a delete primitive at least for tracks.

### Wrinkles / carried questions

- **Pointing borrows the UI selection.** `selectSlot` visibly moves the
  user's selection (2 changes during 3-cursor setup; user confirmed
  visually). Not a correctness problem, but a UX wart under optimistic
  application. Phase-1 candidates: restore prior selection after a batch,
  and/or investigate selection-free pointing further. → DECISIONS.
- **Pin behavior when the user drags/moves the pinned clip is ambiguous ◐.**
  After drag-away, the cursor still reported sceneIndex=0 *and* 2 notes —
  consistent with either stale cached reads on a dead cursor or the drag
  not doing what we assumed. Needs a controlled retest in E2 including
  `clip.exists()` in every read (readback verification catches this class
  of problem regardless, per §8c).
- Reads on a non-existent/stale cursor may serve cached step data —
  E2 must characterize `getStep` behavior when `exists()` is false.

### Decision impact

- Addressing model (DECISIONS-to-be): **pool of pinned, non-following
  cursor tracks + clips; point via trackThenSlot; verify settle by poll;
  address objects, not indices.** Pool size TBD in E5.
- daw-mcp's `selectionDelayMs` approach is confirmed obsolete.
- §12 open question #1: answered **yes** (pinning survives user
  interaction), with the drag-a-pinned-clip caveat above.

## E0 — Toolchain bring-up (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● complete.** Extension builds, loads in Bitwig 6.0.6, and the
full TCP round-trip works. All 8 probe checks pass (`brain: npm run probe:e00`).

### Settled facts

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Bitwig | 6.0.6, reports `hostApiVersion` **25** at runtime |
| extension-api artifact | **25** (only version served on maven.bitwig.com; older versions are unpublished) |
| Extension runtime JVM | **Java 25** (Azul), bundled with Bitwig |
| Bytecode target | `--release 21` works; Bitwig's own bundled extensions are also major-65 (Java 21) |
| Build | Gradle 9.6 + local JDK 26 cross-compiling to 21; `gradle copyExtension` deploys |
| Transport | TCP loopback :8686, newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 — confirmed incl. 20KB payloads, unicode, out-of-band error frames |
| Threading | requests marshaled via `host.scheduleTask` run on thread `"Control Surface Session"` |

### Gotchas discovered (the E0 blocker)

1. **Extension discovery is via ServiceLoader, not the manifest.** Bitwig 6
   requires `META-INF/services/com.bitwig.extension.ExtensionDefinition`
   listing the definition class. The `Extension-Class` manifest attribute
   (which daw-mcp's build.gradle sets) is ignored — daw-mcp's *released*
   jar contains the services file even though its Gradle build doesn't
   create it. Without it: `extension-registry error … No extensions found
   in <jar>`, and the extension silently never appears in the vendor list.
2. **The bundled javadoc's API-version annotations lag.** Newest "API
   version N" mentions in 6.0.6's bundled docs stop at 22, but the host
   actually serves 25. Trust `host.getHostApiVersion()` (or the maven
   artifact), not doc-annotation archaeology.
3. **Bitwig watches the Extensions folder and hot-reloads on file change.**
   Redeploying a running extension restarts it in place (bridge socket
   comes back up) — no Bitwig restart needed after the initial add. Errors
   from a failed scan appear in `~/Library/Logs/Bitwig/BitwigStudio.log`
   under `extension-registry`.
4. First-time activation is manual: Settings → Controllers → Add
   Controller → vendor "ghostnote" (no auto-detect with 0 MIDI ports).

### Decision impact

- Toolchain decision (DECISIONS-to-be): Java 21 target, extension-api 25,
  Gradle 9, Gson bundled. No obstacles found.
- Transport decision: TCP + newline JSON-RPC confirmed viable; strict
  per-line framing with -32700-and-continue verified (a malformed line
  does not poison the connection).
- Hot-reload (gotcha 3) makes the spike iteration loop fast:
  `gradle copyExtension` + rerun probe, no UI interaction.
