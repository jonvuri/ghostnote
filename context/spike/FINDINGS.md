## Method: how we verify the API surface

Two misses (CLAP DirectParameter API, `channelId`) traced to the SAME
recall failure: grepping individual javadoc class pages for methods already
suspected to exist. High precision, low recall. Corrected method:

- **Authoritative sources are bundled and prose-complete** at
  `/Applications/Bitwig Studio.app/Contents/Resources/Documentation/control-surface/api/`
  — full Javadoc with method-level prose ("Reports the channel UUID"; the
  take-over-strategy caveat on `set()`; observer semantics), "Since" version
  tags, superinterface/inherited-method links. There is **no separate
  conceptual scripting guide bundled** (only this javadoc + hardware PDFs).
- **For complete recall, grep the search index, not class pages:**
  `member-search-index.js` lists **all 1968 members** across every class;
  one grep for a concept ("channelId", "DirectParameter") surfaces every
  match regardless of which class it's on. This catches things a
  Track-scoped grep misses (e.g. identity lives on supertype `Channel`).
- **Mine `new-list.html` by API version:** capabilities added in API 19→25
  are exactly what prior art / reference code predates (channelId=20,
  createParameter=12, DirectParameter display=20). The differentiators
  cluster in recent versions.
- **Read whole class pages incl. "All Superinterfaces" + inherited
  methods** before concluding a capability is absent.
- **Empirical testing remains essential — the prose does NOT document
  behavior.** Every behavioral gotcha we hit was undocumented: gain reads
  2×, `setGain`/`setTimbre` clobber pressure, scene deletion compacts rows,
  empty-slot pointing silently no-ops, `set()` swallowed by take-over,
  direct-write needs `resolution=1`. Docs describe the surface; only
  driving the live API reveals the behavior.
- **Rule: never record a capability ○ from a partial pass.** Confirm
  against member-search-index + new-list + a live probe first.

## E4b — CLAP params via the DirectParameter API (2026-07-19)

**Verdict: ● CLAP direct params ARE accessible — my E4 negative was wrong.**
Prompted by a challenge to the E4 CLAP claim. The typed specific-device
path has no CLAP variant, but `Device` carries a second, **format-agnostic
`DirectParameter` API** (the older one `createParameter` "replaced") that
works on CLAP, VST, and Bitwig devices alike. Probe `e04b`.

### What works (proven on a real CLAP: Stochas, `org.surge-synth-team.stochas`)

- **Self-enumeration**: `addDirectParameterIdObserver` emits an array of
  **all** param IDs — no IDs known upfront (unlike `createParameter`).
  Stochas: 55 params; Polysynth via the same API: 55 params.
- **Names**: `addDirectParameterNameObserver(maxChars, cb)` → per-id names
  ("L1 speed", "L1 steps/measure", "OSC1 Pulse Width", "AEG Attack"). All
  55 named on both devices.
- **Values**: `addDirectParameterNormalizedValueObserver(cb)` → per-id 0..1
  (Polysynth reported real defaults: Attack 0.07, Sustain 0.95).
- **Writes**: `setDirectParameterValueNormalized(id, value, resolution)`
  works on Bitwig F1FREQ (0.693→0.200). **⚠ resolution matters:**
  `resolution=1` took; `resolution=128` did NOT within 1.5s. Use
  `resolution=1` (or investigate the intended semantics). Stochas's own
  params didn't move on write — plugin-specific (some plugins reject host
  writes / gate on host-automation state), not an API limit.

### Mechanism comparison — two parameter APIs, pick per case

| | `createParameter` (E4) | `DirectParameter` (E4b) |
|---|---|---|
| Devices | VST2/VST3/Bitwig (typed) | **any incl. CLAP** |
| Discovery | IDs/indices known upfront | **self-enumerates all IDs** |
| Access | pull (`get()`) | **push (observers, init-time)** |
| Handles | pre-allocated at init | one observer set per cursor device |
| Displays | ✅ `displayedValue()` ("2.59 kHz") | ◐ observer didn't populate (below) |
| Writes | `setImmediately` | `setDirectParameterValueNormalized(…,1)` |

**Implication for the param layer:** DirectParameter is the better
*discovery/enumeration* primitive (self-listing, format-agnostic, one
observer set covers any pointed device) and reaches CLAP. `createParameter`
remains better where displayed values and stable pull-reads matter (Bitwig
internal, known VST indices). A pool cursor-device can carry BOTH: direct
observers for enumeration + typed handles for the devices we deeply support.

### Open detail (not blocking)

- **`addDirectParameterValueDisplayObserver` didn't populate** display
  strings for either device (names/values did). Hypothesis: the display
  channel is **page-scoped** (the DirectParameter API has
  `setParameterPage`/`nextParameterPage`/`isParameterPageSectionVisible`),
  so displays may only stream for the active parameter page, needing page
  navigation to cover all params. Deferred; displayed values are available
  anyway via `createParameter` for typed devices, and normalized values
  suffice for CLAP readback. Revisit in Phase 1 if CLAP display strings are
  wanted.

### Decision impact (updates E4)

- **CLAP is IN scope for direct params** (enumerate + name + value + write),
  via DirectParameter. §6a "VST/CLAP" claim restored for CLAP; the
  differentiator is broader than E4 concluded.
- Param layer carries two APIs by role: DirectParameter for enumeration/CLAP,
  createParameter for typed pull-reads + displays.
- Write via DirectParameter: pass `resolution=1`.
- **Lesson:** a negative capability claim from a single missing-method grep
  is unsafe in this API — verify against the whole `Device` surface + a live
  test before recording an ○. (Good catch by the user.)

---

## E4 — Direct parameter layer (§6a differentiator) (2026-07-19)

**Verdict: ● the differentiating capability WORKS and exceeds the plan.**
`createParameter` gives named, valued, settable, repointable handles far
past the 8-per-remote-page ceiling, and the Bitwig-internal param IDs —
INITIAL_PROMPT's "harder case" needing semi-manual harvesting — turn out
to be **sitting in the app bundle as plain text**. Probe `e04`, all green.

### Enumeration proof (§6a "effective enumeration")

Pre-allocated 16 `SpecificBitwigDevice.createParameter(String id)` handles
on a repointable cursor device. Pointed at a freshly-inserted Polysynth,
14/16 resolved (2 harvested IDs were section markers, not params), each
**self-describing**: name + normalized value + human displayed value, e.g.
`F1FREQ="Filter Frequency"=2.59 kHz`, `F1RESO="Filter Resonance"=39.5 %`,
`OSCMIX="OSC 1/2 Mix"=0.00 %`. This is the WigAI issue-#15 gap closed:
arbitrary count of named params, not capped at 8. Params became live
**~194ms after device insert** (device insert itself ~144ms).

### Param ID harvesting — much easier than assumed (§6a upgrade)

Bitwig-internal device param IDs are readable straight from
`…/Bitwig Studio.app/Contents/Resources/Library/device-settings/<uuid>/
Default.bwpreset` (`strings | grep -E '^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{2,}$'`). Polysynth
yielded 63 tokens, ~14/16 sampled were valid createParameter IDs (rest are
section markers: CONTENTS, MODULATORS, FAKE1…). **No `can-copy-device-and-
param-ids` context-menu workflow needed** — the whole internal-device
catalog is harvestable offline from the bundle. Promotes §6a's "one-time
semi-manual harvest, plausibly a community artifact" to "a script over the
app bundle." (Validity still needs a resolve-check per ID against a live
device, since presets include non-param tokens.)

### Read/write + the take-over trap

- **`param.value().setImmediately(v)` works** (0..1 normalized); round-trips
  exactly and the displayed string tracks it (`0.25`→"75.4 Hz",
  `0.8`→"6.08 kHz").
- **⚠ `param.value().set(v)` is SILENTLY SWALLOWED** by the controller's
  take-over strategy (a plain `set` "may not be set immediately if the user
  configured a take over strategy" — value stayed exactly at the preset
  default). ⇒ **all agent param writes must use `setImmediately`, never
  `set`.** This is the param-layer analogue of E2's gain/pressure traps:
  another silent-no-op write path that only readback verification would
  catch. → DECISIONS.

### Repointing — the pre-allocation architecture question, ANSWERED

`createParameter` handles bind to the **cursor device**, not a fixed slot,
and follow it as it repoints:
- **Within a chain:** `selectDevice(bank.getDevice(i))` moved the cursor
  across two Polysynths; the same 16 handles read/wrote each independently
  (device[1] F1FREQ=0.1 vs device[0]=0.8, no cross-talk).
- **Across tracks:** pointing the parent cursor-track at gn-B moved the
  device cursor (FIRST_INSTRUMENT follow) to gn-B's device; handles read it.
- ⇒ **the §3a "pre-allocate a pool, repoint" strategy applies to params
  exactly as it did to clips (E1).** A modest pool of cursor-devices ×
  N param handles covers the session; no per-slot allocation explosion.

### Type specificity + pinning subtleties

- **`SpecificBitwigDevice(uuid)` view is device-type-specific:** pointed at
  a Polymer, all Polysynth param handles report `exists=false`. So a param
  pool must carry a view **per device type** we want deep access to (the
  cursor device itself still enumerates any device's name/position). Per-type
  ID catalogs are the unit of the eventual catalog.
- **Device-cursor `isPinned` is subordinate to its track cursor:** pinning
  the device cursor does NOT hold the device when its parent cursor-track is
  repointed (params jumped to gn-A's device after a track move). **The
  robust hold is: pin the TRACK cursor (E1) + address the device by
  `selectDevice(index)`.** With the track pinned, params stayed on gn-B's
  device (GAIN=0.33) under a selection change. → DECISIONS: device pool
  addressing = pinned track cursor + explicit device index, not device-pin.

### Scope note (superseded by E4b)

- The **typed** specific-device path is VST2/VST3/Bitwig only — no
  `createSpecificClapDevice`. My first reading ("CLAP direct params NOT
  accessible") was **WRONG**: it ruled out one path and missed the
  format-agnostic `DirectParameter` API. See E4b — CLAP params ARE
  accessible. VST index-path (`SpecificPluginDevice.createParameter(int)`)
  still unexercised (needs a known VST id-at-init); deferred.

### Decision impact

- **§6a differentiator confirmed buildable** — named/valued param access at
  arbitrary count, repointable via the pool model, with an offline-harvestable
  internal-device catalog. This is the genuinely novel capability and it holds.
- **Writes: `setImmediately` only** (take-over swallows `set`).
- **Device addressing model:** pinned track cursor + `selectDevice(index)`;
  per-device-type `SpecificBitwigDevice` views; pool of cursor-devices ×
  param handles sized in E5.
- **Param catalog:** promote to a straightforward Phase-1/2 deliverable
  (harvest bundle → resolve-check per device). CLAP excluded; VST via index.

## E3 — Structural ops & revert correctness (2026-07-19)

**Verdict: ● the optimistic-application posture is sound — native undo is
unusable for batch revert (as §8a predicted), and snapshot-based revert
works even for the hardest structural case.** Probes `e03` + `e03b`.

### The headline: undo granularity (§8a confirmed, decisively)

**Bitwig does NOT coalesce operations into undo transactions.** A 4-note
write took **exactly 4 undos** to unwind whether sent as one request
(4 `setStep` in a single handler call) or four separate requests. There is
no `beginUndoStep`/grouping hook in the API. Combined with the stack being
**project-global** (`canUndo` stayed true after we cleared our own notes —
our earlier structural ops were still on it), this kills native undo as a
revert mechanism outright: "undo the agent's last batch" maps to N global
history entries interleaved with the user's own edits. **Owning revert is
mandatory, exactly as INITIAL_PROMPT §8a assumed — now proven, not
assumed.**

### Revert-fidelity roundtrip (§8b confirmed)

Full cycle works: snapshot a clip's notes (verbose scan) → `deleteObject`
the whole clip → recreate via `createNewLauncherClip` → re-point cursor →
replay snapshot → readback matches exactly. **Structural delete is losslessly
reversible via snapshot replay**, no inverse-op algebra needed. This is the
§8b primitive demonstrated end-to-end on the launcher.

### Deletion surface — all four levels work

`deleteObject()` confirmed working with settle times:
Track ~140ms (E1) · ClipLauncherSlot ~24–145ms (E2/E3) · **Device ~140ms**
· **Scene ~instant**. Every structural create has a working delete ⇒ every
structural create is revertible.

### Devices (bonus E4 head start)

- **Insert Bitwig device by UUID works**: `cursorTrack
  .endOfDeviceChainInsertionPoint().insertBitwigDevice(UUID)`. Settle
  ~600–640ms (real plugin load, much slower than note/track ops — batches
  touching devices must budget for this).
- **Device chain re-indexes on delete** (like tracks): deleting device[0]
  shifted the survivor from index 1→0.
- **DeviceBank on a pool cursor track enumerates the chain** (name+exists);
  `itemCount()` gives true length.
- **Device UUID catalog harvested** from
  `…/Bitwig Studio.app/Contents/Resources/Library/device-settings/<uuid>/
  Default.bwpreset`: Polysynth `a9ffacb5-33e9-4fc7-8621-b1af31e410ef`,
  Polymer `8f58138b-…`, Sampler `468bc14b-…`, Test Tone, Organ, Sine, FM-4,
  Phase-4. The §6a "harvest a device catalog" idea is mechanically trivial
  for Bitwig internal devices — the whole map is sitting in the app bundle.

### Scenes — compaction + a real staleness trap

- `Project.createScene()` appends at the end (instant); `Scene.deleteObject()`
  via `sceneBank.getScene(i)` works.
- **Deleting a scene COMPACTS rows below it upward** (confirmed by pitch:
  markers at rows 9/10 moved to 8/9, row 10 emptied). So scene deletion
  shifts clip addresses — the launcher grid is not sparse/absolute.
- **⚠ A pinned cursor's `sceneIndex()` goes PERMANENTLY STALE after scene
  compaction** (still read 10 after 3.1s while the clip was really at row 9).
  Its content tracking and clip-object binding stayed perfect (pitch 64),
  and `trackPosition` tracks track-structural changes correctly (E1) — but
  `sceneIndex` does **not** track scene-structural changes on a held pin.
  ⇒ **after any scene create/delete, the executor must re-point/re-resolve
  cursors; never trust a pre-existing pin's sceneIndex across a scene
  structural op.** Note this interacts with our `point()` verification,
  which checks `sceneIndex === expected` — re-point fresh (re-run
  `selectSlot`) rather than trusting the stale pin.

### Two "FAILs" in the probe output — both are the findings, not defects

`e03` and `e03b` each show one FAIL: they are the *stale-sceneIndex*
behavior above, asserted as expectations that Bitwig violates. The
extension is behaving correctly; the assertions document real API
behavior. No open defect.

### Decision impact

- **Revert design (DECISIONS): own it via snapshot-replay; do not touch
  native undo.** Confirmed feasible and lossless for notes + structural
  delete.
- **Batch executor:** budget ~600ms per device insert; re-resolve cursors
  after scene ops; the existing "verify target before write" rule (E2)
  extends to "re-point after any structural change, don't trust held
  positional metadata."
- **Param catalog (§6a):** Bitwig-internal device UUID→name map is free
  from the app bundle; promotes the catalog idea from "semi-manual harvest"
  to "trivial for internal devices" (VST/CLAP still need the index-scan
  approach — E4).
- Full CRUD deletion surface confirmed ⇒ no structural op is a revert
  dead-end.

## E2 — Note round-trip fidelity, grid, observer gotcha (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● §5's "Exact" checkpoint-fidelity claim holds for the note
surface, with one asterisk (gain).** Probes: `e02` (full sweep, partially
contaminated by external project-state changes mid-run) + `e02b`
(clean re-characterization on known clips).

### Write/read mechanics

- **`setStep` is NOT visible in the same request** — immediate `getStep`
  after `setStep` in one handler returns `Empty`. It IS visible on the
  next request (~25ms incl. round-trip). ⇒ readback verification (§8c)
  must be a separate tick after the write batch, never inline.
- **`getStep` scan cost is trivial:** 512×128 grid = 65k steps scans in
  2–10ms; 64×128 in ~0.4–1ms. Full-clip snapshots are effectively free.
- **Observer gotcha, precisely characterized:** `getStep`/`NoteStep` needs
  NO subscription at all (works on a cursor with zero `markInterested`).
  Every `Value.get()` (exists, name, position…) throws
  `"Either call markInterested() or add at least one observer in init"`
  without a mark. ⇒ mark everything scalar; note data is implicit.
- **Muted notes remain visible** to the NoteOn scan with `isMuted=true` —
  snapshots see them.

### Expression property fidelity (21-property sweep; re-verified on clean fixture)

All setters accepted; round-trip exact (±2e-3) for: velocity,
releaseVelocity, velocitySpread, duration, pan, timbre (float noise only),
transpose (fractional ok), chance+enable, occurrence (enum)+enable,
recurrence (length+mask)+enable, repeat count/curve/velocityCurve/
velocityEnd+enable, isMuted. Two API quirks, both now precisely modeled:

- **`gain` reads back 2× the written value** (reproducible on clean
  state: set 0.7 → immediate read 0.7 [cached] → settled read 1.4; javadoc
  claims 0..1 both ways). Checkpoint restore mapping: write `read/2`.
  Verify the inverse mapping holds in Phase 1; likely a Bitwig doc/API bug.
- **`setGain` and `setTimbre` each RESET `pressure` to 0** (isolated in
  e02e; every other property is innocent; pressure re-set afterwards
  sticks). ⇒ property-write ordering rule: **pressure last** (or at least
  after gain/timbre) in any note-property batch — and §8c readback
  verification catches violations structurally.

### Grid

- **`setStepSize` works at runtime** (note at beat 1.0 re-indexed 4→8
  after 0.25→0.125 switch; needs a settle wait — not instant).
- **Triplet grids work** (stepSize 1/6 round-trips).
- **Off-grid notes are visible on coarser grids, snapped DOWN** (a note
  at beat 0.09375 scans as x=0 on the 0.25 grid) — coarse scans don't
  lose notes but misreport positions; snapshots should scan at the
  finest grid.
- ⇒ grid is a *view*; resolution is per-cursor and changeable. The
  contract can stay beats-native and quantize per operation to a chosen
  grid; no global init-time grid needed (daw-mcp's design was
  unnecessarily rigid).

### Addressing corollaries (feed the batch executor design)

- **Pointing at an EMPTY slot silently lands the cursor on the WRONG
  clip** — observed staying on the previous clip in one trial and
  attaching to a different clip on the target track (slot 0) in another;
  in both cases status looks healthy. ⇒ create-clip must precede
  pointing; the executor MUST verify the cursor's target (track position
  + scene index) before every write — a mis-point is undetectable
  afterwards from the cursor's own state.
- **No stale reads after clip deletion:** `ClipLauncherSlot.deleteObject()`
  (works, ~24ms) leaves the cursor with `exists=false`, scan returns 0
  notes. Cursor reads are trustworthy when `exists=true` + target
  verified.
- **The e02 cross-session anomalies are fully resolved by E2c** (track
  identity bug — see that section): the "fixture" was actually the FX and
  Master rows. Bonus discovery: `createNewLauncherClip` + full note
  editing WORKS on FX/Master launcher slots. After cleanup (E2d) the
  whole E1a + E2 suite re-ran green on a genuine instrument-track
  fixture.
- **Arranger cursor clip:** created fine; `exists=false` with no
  arrangement clip selected. Deeper arrangement probing stays out of
  scope (§9 lean).

### Decision impact

- Checkpoint design (§8b): full-fidelity note snapshots are cheap and
  exact (gain excepted) — snapshot = verbose scan of the write-set clips.
- Readback loop: write → next-tick verify → report; ~25ms per turn.
- Units (§7): contract in beats; extension quantizes via per-op stepSize.
- E3 signals banked: both Track and ClipLauncherSlot `deleteObject()`
  confirmed working.

## E2f — Stable track identity DOES exist: channelId (UUID) (2026-07-19)

**Verdict: ● E2c's "no stable track addressing" was too strong — I missed
`Channel.channelId()`, a per-track UUID (API 20+).** Prompted by the same
"did we miss part of the API?" challenge that surfaced CLAP. Probe `e02f`,
all green. bank index and name remain brittle (E2c stands on those), but
they are **not the only identifiers** — there is a stable one.

### What channelId is

`track.channelId()` → `StringValue`, javadoc "Reports the channel UUID."
Every track (incl. FX and Master) reports a distinct, UUID-shaped id, e.g.
gn-A = `b07f6b06-8f4f-4f4f-802d-ddf1a5190515`. (`channelIndex()`, API 22,
also exists but is just the mutable index as a value.)

### Proven stable (in-session)

- **Survives index shifts:** inserting a track ahead of gn-A/gn-B shifted
  their positions but their channelIds (and the tracks they name) were
  unchanged.
- **Survives rename:** renaming gn-A→"renamed-A" left channelId identical.
- **Clean tombstone:** a deleted track's UUID resolves to found=false — no
  aliasing onto whatever slid into its index.
- **Re-resolvable:** scanning the bank for a matching channelId returns the
  track's *current* index/name/type — the addressing primitive
  (`track.resolveByChannelId`). gn-A's UUID was byte-identical across
  separate probe runs and all structural churn this session; a
  delete+recreate of gn-B correctly minted a NEW UUID (recreated = new
  object).

### The addressing model this unlocks

**Address tracks by channelId, resolve to a live index/object on demand.**
This is the serializable identity E2c said was missing:
- Store channelId in patches/checkpoints, not bank index or name.
- On each operation, `resolveByChannelId` → current index → point a pool
  cursor (E1). Combines with E1's pinned-cursor *in-session* handle: UUID
  is the durable key, the pinned cursor is the fast live handle.
- The E2c fixture bug (identifying a created track by "last Instrument"
  positional heuristic → renamed/deleted the wrong track) is exactly what
  UUID-diff prevents. **The corrected probe identifies a newly-created
  track as "the channelId not present before"** — robust regardless of
  where `createInstrumentTrack` actually drops it (which E2f re-confirmed
  is inconsistent: the newcomer landed at index 0 here vs index 1 in E2c).

### Cross-SESSION persistence — ● CONFIRMED

User saved the project, fully quit Bitwig, and reopened. All six tracks'
channelIds matched the captured UUIDs **byte-for-byte** (gn-A
`b07f6b06-…`, gn-B `9096b9f6-…`, plus Inst 1/Audio 2/FX 1/Master).
channelId is a **persistent, serializable** identity that survives a full
application restart + project reload — exactly the durable key checkpoints
need. (Recreated tracks get a fresh UUID; a given track keeps its UUID for
the life of the project.)

### Decision impact (amends E2c)

- **Track addressing = channelId (UUID) as the stable key + resolve-to-index
  + pool cursor.** Supersedes "no stable addressing"; E2c's brittleness
  finding now applies specifically to *index and name*, not identity.
- Checkpoints/patches serialize channelIds, never indices/names.
- Same question worth checking for clips/scenes/devices: is there an
  equivalent stable id? (Slots are addressed within a track; scenes have
  `sceneIndex` which E3 showed shifts. Worth a pass in Phase 1.)
- **Lesson reinforced (twice now): don't record a capability ○ from a
  partial API pass.** channelId (API 20) and the DirectParameter API were
  both present and both initially missed.

---

## E2c — Track identity: the fixture-contamination root cause (2026-07-18)

> **Amended by E2f:** the "no stable track addressing" conclusion is too
> strong — `channelId()` (UUID) IS stable. This section's brittleness
> findings apply to **bank index and name specifically**, which remain the
> wrong things to address by. Read with E2f.

**Verdict: ● the cross-session anomalies were OUR bug — addressing tracks
by (bank index | name) is unsound. Three API facts, all confirmed by
controlled trials (`e02c`):**

1. **The flat TrackBank includes the FX section and the MASTER track**
   after the regular tracks. `trackType()` distinguishes them
   (Instrument/Audio/Effect/Master/Hybrid/Group). daw-mcp-derived code
   treated bank size as "number of regular tracks" — wrong.
2. **`Application.createInstrumentTrack(position)` does not honor bank
   positions:** requesting the end (9) landed at index 7 (end of the
   *regular* section, before FX/Master); requesting 0 landed at index 1.
   The position argument cannot be trusted; the only safe procedure is
   create → diff the bank → locate the new row empirically.
3. **Default track names auto-renumber** ("Inst 2", "Audio 3" are
   positional auto-names, not stable identities). Name-based identity is
   meaningless for unnamed tracks, and `setName(bankIndex)` renames
   whatever currently sits at that index.

**Combined effect on E1/E2 sessions:** every `ensureFixtureTracks` run
created a track that landed *not* at the assumed index, then renamed the
wrong row — accumulating orphaned "Inst N" tracks and, at least once,
sticking the fixture name onto the tail of the bank (the row typed
Master now carries the name "gn-A"). Cross-session name lookups then
found the wrong tracks, explaining the E2 phase D/E anomalies and the
user's "gn-A wasn't there" observation. In-session fingerprint-verified
results (all of E1's core verdicts, E2's mechanics) are self-consistent
and stand.

**Resolution (same day):** user visually confirmed (screenshots): the
Master row was named "gn-A", fixture clips lived on the FX/Master rows,
and the default template was Inst+Audio+FX+Master — every extra
Instrument row was a ghostnote orphan. Cleanup probe (`e02d`) removed
our clips from FX/Master, restored the Master name, and deleted the five
verified-empty orphans; fixture code (`lib.ensureFixtureTracks`) now
matches by name+type, locates created tracks as last-Instrument-row, and
poll-verifies renames. E1a and E2 both re-ran green on the clean fixture.

**Decision impact (batch executor / contract):**
- Track creation in the contract must return the *located* new track
  (create → diff → verify), never assume the requested position.
- All track addressing must be type-aware; Effect/Master rows are never
  fixture/rename/delete targets by index.
- Rename operations must poll-verify the rename landed where intended.
- This is the strongest argument yet for §8e verification semantics:
  every structural op needs its own readback, not just note writes.

---

## E1 — Addressing: pointing, pinning, cursor pool (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● address-don't-select is achievable.** The pool-of-cursors
architecture works: writes land on programmatically chosen clips and are
immune to concurrent user interaction. E1a: 26/28 (the 2 "failures" were
mechanism discovery, see below). E1b (interactive): all real checks passed;
the one FAIL was a mis-designed control test (see 4).

### The working architecture

Per pool slot: a dedicated `CursorTrack` created with
`shouldFollowSelection=false` + its `PinnableCursorClip`
(`cursorTrack.createLauncherCursorClip(w, h)`). Pointing mechanism —
the only one of three candidates that works (**"trackThenSlot"**):

```java
cursorTrack.selectChannel(trackBank.getItemAt(t));  // point the track
track.selectSlot(s);                                 // point the slot
// then pin: cursorClip.isPinned().set(true)
```

Settle is **~25ms, verifiable by polling** `clip.getTrack().position()` +
`clip.clipLauncherSlot().sceneIndex()` — vs. daw-mcp's blind 400ms sleep.

Rejected mechanisms: `slot.select()` alone (pool clips do not follow
global clip selection — their cursor tracks don't follow, and the clip
cursor is scoped to its track) and `CursorClip.selectClip(followerClip)`
(does not repoint cross-track; timed out).

### Evidence highlights

1. **Pool independence ●** — 3 cursors pinned to 3 different clips
   concurrently, each reads back its own fingerprint.
2. **User-interference immunity ●** — 20/20 write+readback cycles correct
   while the user clicked continuously around the session view
   (27 selection changes observed during the test window).
3. **Structural shift: pins follow the object ●** — creating a track at
   position 0 shifted the pinned cursor's reported position +1 with
   content intact; deleting restored it. Bank *indices* drift (fixture
   moved between sessions in testing) ⇒ the brain must resolve addresses
   to objects (via pointed cursors), never store raw bank indices.
4. **Selection-following is opt-in by construction ●** — pool cursors
   never follow user selection even unpinned (`followSelection=false` at
   creation). The E1b "control test" FAIL was this architecture working:
   the test wrongly expected an unpinned pool cursor to follow a click
   (compounded by clicking an already-selected clip = no change event).
   Pinning is belt-and-suspenders on top of a non-following cursor.
5. **`Track.deleteObject()` works ●** (~144ms settle) — early E3 positive:
   structural revert has a delete primitive at least for tracks.

### Wrinkles / carried questions

- **Pointing borrows the UI selection.** `selectSlot` visibly moves the
  user's selection (2 changes during 3-cursor setup; user confirmed
  visually). Not a correctness problem, but a UX wart under optimistic
  application. Phase-1 candidates: restore prior selection after a batch,
  and/or investigate selection-free pointing further. → DECISIONS.
- **Pin behavior when the user drags/moves the pinned clip is ambiguous ◐.**
  After drag-away, the cursor still reported sceneIndex=0 *and* 2 notes —
  consistent with either stale cached reads on a dead cursor or the drag
  not doing what we assumed. Needs a controlled retest in E2 including
  `clip.exists()` in every read (readback verification catches this class
  of problem regardless, per §8c).
- Reads on a non-existent/stale cursor may serve cached step data —
  E2 must characterize `getStep` behavior when `exists()` is false.

### Decision impact

- Addressing model (DECISIONS-to-be): **pool of pinned, non-following
  cursor tracks + clips; point via trackThenSlot; verify settle by poll;
  address objects, not indices.** Pool size TBD in E5.
- daw-mcp's `selectionDelayMs` approach is confirmed obsolete.
- §12 open question #1: answered **yes** (pinning survives user
  interaction), with the drag-a-pinned-clip caveat above.

## E0 — Toolchain bring-up (2026-07-18)

**Verdict: ● complete.** Extension builds, loads in Bitwig 6.0.6, and the
full TCP round-trip works. All 8 probe checks pass (`brain: npm run probe:e00`).

### Settled facts

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Bitwig | 6.0.6, reports `hostApiVersion` **25** at runtime |
| extension-api artifact | **25** (only version served on maven.bitwig.com; older versions are unpublished) |
| Extension runtime JVM | **Java 25** (Azul), bundled with Bitwig |
| Bytecode target | `--release 21` works; Bitwig's own bundled extensions are also major-65 (Java 21) |
| Build | Gradle 9.6 + local JDK 26 cross-compiling to 21; `gradle copyExtension` deploys |
| Transport | TCP loopback :8686, newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 — confirmed incl. 20KB payloads, unicode, out-of-band error frames |
| Threading | requests marshaled via `host.scheduleTask` run on thread `"Control Surface Session"` |

### Gotchas discovered (the E0 blocker)

1. **Extension discovery is via ServiceLoader, not the manifest.** Bitwig 6
   requires `META-INF/services/com.bitwig.extension.ExtensionDefinition`
   listing the definition class. The `Extension-Class` manifest attribute
   (which daw-mcp's build.gradle sets) is ignored — daw-mcp's *released*
   jar contains the services file even though its Gradle build doesn't
   create it. Without it: `extension-registry error … No extensions found
   in <jar>`, and the extension silently never appears in the vendor list.
2. **The bundled javadoc's API-version annotations lag.** Newest "API
   version N" mentions in 6.0.6's bundled docs stop at 22, but the host
   actually serves 25. Trust `host.getHostApiVersion()` (or the maven
   artifact), not doc-annotation archaeology.
3. **Bitwig watches the Extensions folder and hot-reloads on file change.**
   Redeploying a running extension restarts it in place (bridge socket
   comes back up) — no Bitwig restart needed after the initial add. Errors
   from a failed scan appear in `~/Library/Logs/Bitwig/BitwigStudio.log`
   under `extension-registry`.
4. First-time activation is manual: Settings → Controllers → Add
   Controller → vendor "ghostnote" (no auto-detect with 0 MIDI ports).

### Decision impact

- Toolchain decision (DECISIONS-to-be): Java 21 target, extension-api 25,
  Gradle 9, Gson bundled. No obstacles found.
- Transport decision: TCP + newline JSON-RPC confirmed viable; strict
  per-line framing with -32700-and-continue verified (a malformed line
  does not poison the connection).
- Hot-reload (gotcha 3) makes the spike iteration loop fast:
  `gradle copyExtension` + rerun probe, no UI interaction.
